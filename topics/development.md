# Introduction

Questions and debates around the geography of work are often
ultimately about broader and deeper notions of _development_: about
how best to enable the kind of good life, lived in good places, that
we collectively aspire to. And conditions of development exist in
wider historical and geographical context. Of necessity, then, notions
of development are highly variable, and often contentious.

Our questions for this module include:

1. What is development, and how can we measure it? 
2. What are the geographic patterns of development today? 
3. How have ideas about development changed over time? 

Related, if last week we examined the geographic relationships between
core (developed) and semi-peripheral (so called "emerging market")
countries, this week we shift our perspective to the periphery:
towards places that are no so fortunate as to have the sorts of
factory sweatshops that have become the subject of controversy in
other parts of the world.
