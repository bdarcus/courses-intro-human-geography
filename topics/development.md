# Introduction

Questions and debates around the geography of work are often
ultimately about broader and deeper notions of _development_: about
how best to enable the kind of good life that we collectively aspire
to. And conditions of development exist in wider historical and
geographical context. Of necessity, then, notions of development are
highly variable, and often contentious. In part, then, we explore
these issues in this module.

Related, if last module we examined the evolving geographic
relationships between core (developed) and semi-peripheral (so called
"emerging market") countries around manufacturing work, this module we
shift our perspective to the periphery: towards places that are not so
fortunate as to have the sorts of export-oriented factory
manufacturing that have become the subject of controversy in other
parts of the world.

# What is Development?

What does it mean for a place to be "developed"? How would we measure,
and map, geographic patterns of development? It turns out there are a
wide range of answers to these questions. But here we will focus on a
range of common ones so we can appreciate some of the parameters of
debates around development.

Please read, and compare and contrast in your mind, the following
three development measures:

1. [Gross Domestic Product (GDP)][gdp]
2. [Human Development Index (HDI)][hdi]
3. [Gender Empowerment Measure (GEM)][gem]

How do these measures understand development differently? How are the
geographic patterns of these measures similar? How are they different?
Can you find any places in the world where one of these measures may
be relatively high, and another quite low? What factors might explain
that anomaly?
