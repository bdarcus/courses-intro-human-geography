# What is Human Geography?

Geography, you may have come to believe, involves the study of maps
and the static and mundane facts they represent: rivers, capital
cities, international boundaries, etc. If geography ended there,
however, it would be as boring as history that was only about
important dates. Just as the significance of a historical perspective
lies in understanding how a sequence of events adds up to important
changes in the way we live our lives, the significance of geography
lies in understanding how the relationships across space shape our
lives. The study of human geograpy, then, is about people and place:
about where we live, work, and socialize, and how these local lives
are tied into distant worlds.

In an increasingly globally-connected world, the importance of human
geography becomes all the more important. The pace and scope of
geographic connections evident in our everyday lives is
unprecedented. We consume foods, drive cars, wear clothes, and listen
to music that are typically produced in distant places, and influenced
by still by other places. At a banal level, we can see the influence
of globalization all around us. If we walk down a street in many
places in the world, we can see a variety of so-called ethnic
restaurants. At a market, we buy foods that come from all over the
world, while Wal-Mart offers bargain-basement prices by making use of
cheap labor available in Southeast Asia and Central America. If we
move outward from and visit various points around the world, we will
also see similar evidence of globalization. From McDonald’s and
American popular culture, to the increasing accessibility of similar
images and information through global communications technologies,
there is a sense that our world is an increasingly small place.

But as the events of September 11, 2001 or the recent global economic
crisis show quite clearly, while we may indeed live in a global
village, it is also a fundamentally uneven and divided one. As the
world is made increasingly the same through processes of
globalization, I will argue in this course, local places—where we
actually live our lives—remain quite different. At the same time that
increasing numbers of people are part of an emerging global consumer
culture, vast numbers of the world’s population are mired in extreme
poverty. As many of us live lives of unprecedented comfort, many
others live lives marked by violence and indignity. The increasing
global and local connections of the 21st century are simultaneously
vulnerability and opportunity. Globalization is about both of these
two sides to the contemporary geography of the world.

# Basic Geographic Concepts

## Location

So how do geographers operationalize these concerns? Like other disciplines, 
we use a set of concepts. Perhaps the most basic concept in geography is 
_location_: simply and most basically _where_ something 
is. But even this simple concept has some nuances. Nothing of significance
exists in a vaccuum, but rather takes on significance by its relation
to what surrounds it. This gets at the distinction between _absolute
location_ and _relative location_. Absolute location refers to an
objective description of where something is that does not change
depending on context; it is the same _everywhere_. The most common way
we describe such locations is through _latitude_ and _longitude_.

 monument in Kosovo, a place that people have fought over for
 literally centuries. While its absolute location is certainly
 significant, its relative historical location helps explain why it is
 memorialized in the first place. Photo countesy Quinn Dombrowski](http://farm5.staticflickr.com/4151/5007446663_9f856d3937_b.jpg)

## Distance

## Scale

## Diffusion

## Site and Situation

# Basic Geographic Arguments

With these basic concepts in hand, we can begin with some basic
arguments:

1. all places are connected to other places, and therefore _interact_
with each other
2. nevertheless, the quantity and quality of interactions between places differs
substantially
3. places that are closer together, and therefore separated by
less relative distance, tend to interact more
