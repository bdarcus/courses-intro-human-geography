# What is Human Geography?

The study of human geograpy is about relationships between people 
and the earth: about where we live, work, and socialize, and how these 
local lives are tied into distant worlds. 

In an increasingly globally-connected world, the importance of human 
geography becomes all the more important.

we use a set of concepts. Perhaps the most basic concept in geography is 
_location_: simply and most basically _where_ something 
is. But even this simple concept has some nuances.
