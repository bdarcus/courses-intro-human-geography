<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Questions and debates around the geography of work are often ultimately about broader and deeper notions of <em>development</em>: about how best to enable the kind of good life that we collectively aspire to. And conditions of development exist in wider historical and geographical context. Of necessity, then, notions of development are highly variable, and often contentious. In part, then, we explore these issues in this module; the traditional focus of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Development_geography">development geography</a>.</p>
<p>Related, if last module we examined the evolving geographic relationships between core (developed) and semi-peripheral (so called &quot;emerging market&quot;) countries around manufacturing work, this module we shift our perspective to the periphery: towards places that are not so fortunate as to have the sorts of export-oriented factory manufacturing that have become the subject of controversy in other parts of the world.</p>
<h1 id="what-is-development">What is Development?</h1>
<p>What does it mean for a place to be &quot;developed&quot;? How would we measure, and map, geographic patterns of development? It turns out there are a wide range of answers to these questions. But here we will focus on a range of common ones so we can appreciate some of the parameters of debates around development.</p>
<p>Please read, and compare and contrast in your mind, descriptions of the following three development measures:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product">Gross Domestic Product (GDP)</a></li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Development_Index">Human Development Index (HDI)</a></li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_Empowerment_Measure">Gender Empowerment Measure (GEM)</a></li>
</ol>
<p>How do these measures understand development differently? How are the geographic patterns of these measures similar? How are they different? Can you find any places in the world where one of these measures may be relatively high, and another quite low? What factors might explain that inconsistency?</p>
<h1 id="how-should-countries-develop">How Should Countries Develop?</h1>
<p>If development experts disagree on what development is, and how we measure it, they also disagree on the policy measures most effective to improving development in particular places. How should countries develop in the context of an increasingly interdependent global economy?</p>
<p>For two perspectives on these questions, read through the following:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rostovian_take-off_model">Rostow's Stages of Growth</a></li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoliberalism">Neoliberalism</a></li>
</ol>
<p>Consider, in particular, what the two approaches might suggest about how individual countries relate to a global economy.</p>
