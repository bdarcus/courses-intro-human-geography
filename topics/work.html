<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_geography">Economic Geography</a> examines the processes and patterns that structure where different types of work are done and wealth created, the spatial relations among different national, regional and local economies, and the flows of goods, services, and investment that make local economies increasingly globally-interdependent.</p>
<p>One essential question of economic geography might be something as simple as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Who does what work, where, and for whom?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>People coordinate virtually all their work in some fashion, across some geographic space. All work, then, by definition has a geography to it. A teenager in an American home, for example, may be responsible for taking the trash from the kitchen, and placing it on the street for curbside pickup by a professional sanitation worker, who brings that trash to some site somewhere else, where still other people process that trash. There is thus an obvious geography to the work of trash.</p>
<p>Obviously the particular geographic patterns and processes associated with different kinds of work varies with historical and other context. In different times and places, for example, how trash is collected and processed may be quite different. In many places in the developing world today, trash collection and processing works very differently than it does in the developed world (see brief video excerpt below that examines the lives of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zabbaleen">Zabbaleen</a> in Egypt; these are people who collect, and recycle, garbage in the country, and who have their own settlements).</p>

<p>Economic globalization, then, might be understood in part as the dramatic spatial expansion of divisions of labor. In this module, we examine these geographic transformations, and their implications for different kinds of places, and different kinds of work.</p>
