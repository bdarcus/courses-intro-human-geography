# Introduction

Political geography is about the study of power and space. The word power is a simple 
word rich with nuance. But in the context of this course, the following definition is 
probably most appropriate:

> Control or authority over others; dominion, rule; government, command, sway 
> (Oxford English Dictionary).

A political geographer, then, is interested in how power is distributed and connected 
across geographic space. They tend to ask questions such as:

1. Who has what sort of power, over what space(s)?
2. How, and why, do different actors assert power beyond space(s) of their most immediate power 
   and influence?
