# Introduction

# Populations Over Time and Space

## Distributions

People tend to cluster together, and the geography of populations is 
about the dynamic patterns of human settlement and movement. Consider, for 
example, this short video of the earth at night.

The patterns of lightness and darkness are an indirect indicator of where 
people live; of how they are distributed across space. What factors shape these patterns?

## Population Pyramids

Beyond geneneral descriptions of populations as they distribute over space, 
we can also consider their internal composition based on various characteristics, 
including age.

Population pyramids are a way to visualize the age structure of populations.
