<h1 id="what-is-human-geography">What is Human Geography?</h1>
<p>Geography, you may have come to believe, involves the study of maps and the static and mundane facts they represent: rivers, capital cities, international boundaries, etc. If geography ended there, however, it would be as boring as history that was only about important dates. Just as the significance of a historical perspective lies in understanding how a sequence of events adds up to important changes in the way we live our lives, the significance of geography lies in understanding how the relationships across space shape our lives. The study of human geography, then, is about people and place: about where we live, work, and socialize, and how these local lives are tied into distant worlds.</p>
<p>In an increasingly globally-connected world, the importance of human geography becomes all the more important. The pace and scope of geographic connections evident in our everyday lives is unprecedented. We consume foods, drive cars, wear clothes, and listen to music that are typically produced in distant places, and influenced by still by other places. At a banal level, we can see the influence of globalization all around us. If we walk down a street in many places in the world, we can see a variety of so-called ethnic restaurants. At a market, we buy foods that come from all over the world, while Wal-Mart offers bargain-basement prices by making use of cheap labor available in Southeast Asia and Central America. If we move outward from and visit various points around the world, we will also see similar evidence of globalization. From McDonald’s and American popular culture, to the increasing accessibility of similar images and information through global communications technologies, there is a sense that our world is an increasingly small place.</p>
<p>But as the events of September 11, 2001 or the recent global economic crisis show quite clearly, while we may indeed live in a global village, it is also a fundamentally uneven and divided one. As the world is made increasingly the same through processes of globalization, I will argue in this course, local places—where we actually live our lives—remain quite different. At the same time that increasing numbers of people are part of an emerging global consumer culture, vast numbers of the world’s population are mired in extreme poverty. As many of us live lives of unprecedented comfort, many others live lives marked by violence and indignity. The increasing global and local connections of the 21st century are simultaneously vulnerability and opportunity. Globalization is about both of these two sides to the contemporary geography of the world.</p>
<h1 id="basic-geographic-concepts">Basic Geographic Concepts</h1>
<p>So how do geographers operationalize these concerns? Like other disciplines, we use a set of concepts. In the following, I introduce you to some of the basic concepts we use in human geography.</p>
<h2 id="location">Location</h2>
<p>Perhaps the most basic concept in geography is <em>location</em>: simply and most basically <em>where</em> something is. But even this simple concept has some nuances. Nothing of significance exists in a vaccuum, but rather takes on significance by its relation to what surrounds it. This gets at the distinction between <em>absolute location</em> and <em>relative location</em>. Absolute location refers to an objective description of where something is that does not change depending on context; it is the same <em>everywhere</em>. The most common way we describe such locations is through <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system"><em>latitude</em> and <em>longitude</em></a>.</p>

<p>Relative location, by contrast, depends on context, and perspective. If I say &quot;the restaurant next to that coffee shop,&quot; the location of that restaurant only has meaning in relation to something else: the coffee shop. It is therefore a description of <em>relative location</em>. We will come back to the importance of this in a minute.</p>
<h2 id="distance">Distance</h2>
<p>Distance can be described simply as the space between two locations. But as with location, distance can also be described in absolute and relative terms. In geography, we typically describe absolute distance using units such as <em>miles</em> and <em>kilometers</em>. As with absolute location, the notion of an absolute distance does not change depending on context. Ten miles is the same in Africa as it is in Asia; the same in 500 BC as in 2010.</p>
<p>Relative distance, on the other hand, can change substantially depending on historical and other context. Consider a question like &quot;how far is Cincinnati from Chicago?&quot; In the 21st century, we tend to implicitly assume a particular mode of travel when answering that question: most likely a car, or potentially a plane, or even perhaps a train. Each of those modes of transportation will take different time, but the time will be measured in hours regardless. But consider if we were to ask the same question in 1820? At that time, the most likely mode of transportation would be horseback, and the time measured in days. While the absolute distance does not change, the relative distance does quite dramatically. In essence, in the 21st century, Chicago is relatively much closer to Cincinnati than it was in 1820.</p>
<h2 id="scale">Scale</h2>
<p>We tend to use <em>scale</em> in two ways in geography. The first, which we will focus less on here, is as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(map)">ratio in map-making</a> to convert a distance on a map to a (much larger) distance on the earth's surface. The second way we use scale in geography is as a description of the relative size of a pattern or process. In common language, the following are all descriptions of scale:</p>
<ul>
<li>global</li>
<li>regional</li>
<li>national</li>
<li>urban</li>
<li>neighborhood</li>
<li>street</li>
<li>body</li>
</ul>
<p>When we use a term like <em>globalization</em> to describe contemporary change, we are really describing a change in the relative relations among these geographic scales; perhaps implicitly suggesting that processes operating at larger scales are taking increasing precedence over those at smaller scales.</p>
<h2 id="diffusion">Diffusion</h2>
<p>So far, we have been dealing with fairly static concepts. Diffusion is inherently dynamic, and about the movement over space of things (ideas, practices and innovations, people, etc.) from one place to another. Again: let's distinguish two ways to understand diffusion. The most basic we can call <em>spatial diffusion</em> or <em>contagious diffusion</em>. This ideas describes a process where things move much like a virus: from one place to a place that is absolutely closest.</p>
<p><em>Hierarchical diffusion</em>, by contrast, involves movement between places that are most intensely connected. Consider, for example, that there is massively more travel of people between Los Angeles and Manhattan, than there is between a small town in upstate New York and Manhattan, despite the fact that the latter two places are absolutely much closer. Why? Well, one obvious factor is LA and New York are two, very large, intensely-connected, cities.</p>
<p>In practice, though, in the 21st century, much diffusion involves both hierarchical and spatial aspects. Ask yourself: how does the flu, or new fashion styles, diffuse?</p>
<h2 id="site-and-situation">Site and Situation</h2>
<p>Last pair of concepts: <em>site</em> and <em>situation</em>. <em>Site</em> refers to the objective physical characteristics of a place: its location, its physical features, and so forth. <em>Situation</em> refers instead to the particular context a site exists in at any particular time. New York, for example, exists at a particular latitude and longitude, at the confluence of some major rivers, with a fantastic natural harbor. That fact alone cannot explain why it has become the major global city that it is. The natural harbor is mostly meaningless without the technology of ships, and global trade that has, for the past few centuries, been heavily-dependent on shipping.</p>
<h1 id="basic-geographic-arguments">Basic Geographic Arguments</h1>
<p>With these basic concepts in hand, we can begin with some basic arguments:</p>
<ol>
<li>all places are connected to other places, and therefore <em>interact</em> with each other</li>
<li>nevertheless, the quantity and quality of interactions between places differs substantially</li>
<li>places that are closer together, and therefore separated by less relative distance, tend to interact more; those farther away tend to interact less</li>
<li>the scales of connection we are exposed to on a daily basis today are larger and more intense than they were in the past</li>
</ol>
