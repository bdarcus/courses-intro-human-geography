# Introduction

[Economic Geography][econgeo] examines the processes and patterns that structure
where different types of work are done and wealth created, the spatial
relations among different national, regional and local economies, and the
flows of goods, services, and investment that make local economies
increasingly globally-interdependent.

One essential question of economic geography might be something as simple as:

> Who does what work, where, and for whom?

Virtually all human labor is coordinated in some fashion, across some
geographic space. All work, then, by definition has a geography to
it. A teenager in an American home, for example, may be responsible
for taking the trash from the kitchen, and placing it on the street
for curbside pickup by a professional sanitation worker, who brings
that trash to some site somewhere else, where still other people
process that trash. There is thus an abvious geography to the work of
trash.

Obviously the particular geographic patterns and processes associated
with different kind of work, and varies with historical and other
context. In different times and places, for example, how trash is
collected and processed may be quite different. In many places in the
developing world today, trash collection and processing works very
differently than it does in the developed world.

Globalization might be understood in part as the dramatic spatial
expansion of divisions of labor. In 1965, for example, Ford Motor
Company may have produced a Mustang through a process coordinated
across a number of factories largely confined to a particular region
of the United States. In 2013, Ford produces Mustangs with parts that
comes from factories across ** countries on ** continents. The company
itself has entered into cross-border joint ventures with large
multinational companies in Asia (Mazda) and Europe (**).
