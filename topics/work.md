# Introduction

[Economic Geography][econgeo] examines the processes and patterns that structure
where different types of work are done and wealth created, the spatial
relations among different national, regional and local economies, and the
flows of goods, services, and investment that make local economies
increasingly globally-interdependent.

One essential question of economic geography might be something as simple as:

> Who does what work, where, and for whom?

People coordinate virtually all their work in some fashion, across some
geographic space. All work, then, by definition has a geography to
it. A teenager in an American home, for example, may be responsible
for taking the trash from the kitchen, and placing it on the street
for curbside pickup by a professional sanitation worker, who brings
that trash to some site somewhere else, where still other people
process that trash. There is thus an obvious geography to the work of
trash.

Obviously the particular geographic patterns and processes associated
with different kinds of work varies with historical and other context.
In different times and places, for example, how trash is collected and
processed may be quite different. In many places in the developing
world today, trash collection and processing works very differently
than it does in the developed world (see brief video excerpt below
that examines the lives of the [Zabbaleen][zab] in Egypt; these are
people who collect, and recycle, garbage in the country, and who have
their own settlements).

Economic globalization, then, might be understood in part as the
dramatic spatial expansion of divisions of labor. In this module, we
examine these geographic transformations, and their implications for
different kinds of places, and different kinds of work.
