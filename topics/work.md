# Introduction

One essential question of economic geography might be something as simple as:

> Who does what work, where, and for whom?

All work is coordinated in some fashion, across some geographic space. All work, then, by 
definition has a geography to it. A teenager in an American home, for example, may be responsible for taking 
the trash from the kitchen, and placing it on the street for curbside pickup by a professional sanitation 
worker, who brings that trash to some site somewhere else, where still other people process that trash. There 
is thus an abvious geohgraphy to the work of trash.

Obviously the particular geographic patterns and processes associated with different kind of work, and with 
historical and other context.

Globalization might be understood in part as the dramatic spatial expansion of divisions of labor. In 1965, for example, 
Ford Motor Company may have produced a Mustang through a process coordinated across a number of factories largely 
confined to a particular region of the United States. In 2012, Ford produces Mustangs with parts that comes factories 
across ** countries on ** continents. The company itself has entered into cross-border joint ventures with large 
multinational companies in Asia (Mazda) and Europe (**).
