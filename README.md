# Introduction

This is an experiment in open content mini-textbook for an
introduction to geography course, but designed for the web. 

# Goals

This project is not intended to recreate the traditional kitchen-sink
approach to contemporary physical textbooks, but instead to do two things:

1. to provide focused, readable, dynamic, and remixable content
2. to do so using the latest technology standards

More concretely, the text will include:

* no fluff at all; the focus is on providing a tight, coherent, argument
* contemporary examples that are constantly updated
* dynamic data and visualizations where appropriate and practical

See project wiki for more information.
