<dl>
<dt>Absolute Distance</dt>
<dd><p>Absolute distance is an objective measure that does not vary. Common absolute measures of distance could be miles or kilometers, for example.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Absolute Location</dt>
<dd><p>Absolute location does not vary depending on perspective or context. Common measures of absolute location include latitude and longitude.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Distance</dt>
<dd><p>In general, the space between two points or locations. There are two predominant ways to understand this notion: <em>Absolute Distance</em> and <em>Relative Distance</em>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Location</dt>
<dd><p>Put simply, where something is on a two-dimensional plain. There are two predominant ways to understand this notion: <em>Absolute Location</em> and <em>Relative Location</em>. See also <em>Site</em> and <em>Situation</em>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Place</dt>
<dd><p>In both the English language generally, and in human geography in particular, <em>place</em> is a concept rich with nuance. At the most mundane, a place is just some location with a unique mix of characteristics. See also <em>Site</em> and <em>Situation</em>, and <em>Location</em>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Relative Distance</dt>
<dd><p>Relative distance varies depending on context: technology, the content between the locations, etc. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Oxford is roughly forty-minutes by car from Cincinnati</li>
<li>New York is five hours by plane from Los Angeles</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that distance here depends among other things on how fast one travels; the times in the examples above assume a particular average speed.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Relative Location</dt>
<dd><p>Relative location identifies where something is in relation to other locations or places. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Liberty, Indiana is West of Oxford</li>
<li>Canada is North of the United States</li>
<li>my favorite restaurant is next to the gas station</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>Scale</dt>
<dd><p>The horizontal size of a given geographic unit, area, or process. In geography, we typically talk in scales that range from the human body, to the street or or neightborhood, to the city or region, and on to the globe.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Site</dt>
<dd><p>Related to <em>location</em>; where something is in the most basic sense, but also the characteristics of that place. For example, a city might be located on the coast at some <em>absolute location</em>, contain a natural harbor, and so forth.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Situation</dt>
<dd><p>A site's place in larger geographic context. For example, a harbor wouldn't be much use without boats. An interior continental location far from any water body might suggest intense isolation without planes, trains and automobiles. The idea simply suggests that a place's position in the world evolves based on changing technology, politics, culture and so forth.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1 id="spatial-interaction">Spatial Interaction</h1>
<dl>
<dt>Accessibility</dt>
<dd><p>How easy it is to access a place. For example, for much of human history, coastal locations with good natural harbors provided greatly enhanced accessibilty. Conversely, a location in a mountainous area often greatly dmininshes accessiblity.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Complementarity</dt>
<dd><p>When considering potential interactions between places, complementarity refers to the fact that each much offer something to the other.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Diffusion</dt>
<dd><p>The spread of something (a disease, an innovation, information) from one <em>location</em> to another.</p>
<p>Diffusion originally comes from biology, where the concept is understood as the movement (often across cell walls) of a solution of high concentration to areas of low-concentration. The understanding in geography is broadly similar, but differs in two important respects. First, while biology may deal with scales even smaller than individual cells, geography typically deals with processes happening at much larger scales: the city, the region, the nation, the globe. Second, geography (certainly human geography) is typically concerned not so much with the movement of biophysical or chemical material, but rather of more human things such as information, ideas, culture, and so forth.</p>
<p>In human geography, we distinguish between two broadly different mechanisms of diffusion: <em>Spatial Diffusion</em> and <em>Hierarchical Diffusion</em>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Hierarchical Diffusion</dt>
<dd><p>In hierarchical diffusion, things diffuse not to areas that are absolutely closest, but rather to areas of close <em>relative distance</em>. Consider, for example, that Syracuse, New York is absolutely much closer to New York City than is Chicago. Nevertheless, we expect much more traffic between New York and Chicago, than between New York and Syracuse. For this reason, we often see diffusion happen first between places which are large and have more intense spatial interaction.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Intervening Opportunity</dt>
<dd><p>When considering the possibility of interaction between any two places, intervening opportunity refers to the reality that there are always additional places that may offer the same benefits of interaction. An intervening opportunity, then, can change the patterns of connection between places.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Spatial Diffusion</dt>
<dd><p>This is the most basic form of <em>diffusion</em> and involves movement from a place to surrouding places. So the primary criterion that defines this pattern of movement is <em>absolute distance</em>; movement happens first to areas that are closest. It's for this reason the concept is also sometimes called <em>contagious diffusion</em> (consider how a cold virus spreads within a dorm room, or a campus, for example).</p>
</dd>
<dt>Transferability</dt>
<dd><p>When considering whatever it is that is transferred between two <em>locations</em>, transferability refers to the characteristics of thing been transferred. For example, a tractor is not very transferable, because it is large and very heavy. By contrast, a tshirt or a computer chip has very high transferabilty.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1 id="economic-geography">Economic Geography</h1>
<dl>
<dt>Agglomeration Economies</dt>
<dd><p>Circumstances that benefit from the spatial co-presence of different components of an economic process, where greater absolute distance would raise costs.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Disagglomeration Economies</dt>
<dd><p>Circumstances that benefit from the spatial dispersal of different components of an economic process, where greater costs associated with greater absolute distance are outweighed by lowered costs elsewhere.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Divison of Labor</dt>
<dd><p>Most simply, different people doing different work as part of an economy.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Fordism</dt>
<dd><p>A social and economic system that involves vertically-integrated mass-production, relative peace between capital and labor mediated by strong government involvement.</p>
</dd>
<dt>International Division of Labor</dt>
<dd><p>A spatial division of labor that spans international borders.</p>
</dd>
<dt>New International Division of Labor</dt>
<dd><p>One way to describe the globalization of manufacturing economies beginning in the 1960s. This division of labor involved the movement of lower-skill manufacturing work from core to periphery and semi-periphery.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Old International Division of Labor</dt>
<dd><p>A division of labor largely associated with the era of European colonialism, where former colonies provided raw materials to core states, which in turn produced higher-value finished goods. Often colonial powers enforced these unequal trade relationships through force, or other coercion.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Post-Fordism</dt>
<dd><p>A social and economic system characterized by vertically-disintegrated production, and less government engagement in the economy, and in labor rights.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Spatial Divison of Labor</dt>
<dd><p>The fact that divisions of labor take place in space; that <em>where</em> work gets done may be as significant as <em>who</em> does that work.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Vertical Integration</dt>
<dd><p>The integration of the complete range of a production process under the direct control of a firm. The classic example is the original <em>Ford Motor Company</em>, which owned the complete range from rubber plantations, to production lines, to auto dealerships and insurance.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Vertical Disintegration</dt>
<dd><p>Where firms spin off certain segments of their production process to other firms (subcontractors), giving more geographic and business flexibility.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1 id="political-geography">Political Geography</h1>
<dl>
<dt>Geopolitics</dt>
<dd><p>The geographical relations of power among different entities; typically states. May involve various practical and imaginative dimensions.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Nation</dt>
<dd><p>An &quot;imagined community&quot; of people that assert a common identity rooted in a common historical experience, ethnicity, language, and so forth.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Nation-State</dt>
<dd><p>An idealized state geographically coterminous with a nation, typically without significant internal differences.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Sovereignty</dt>
<dd><p>Control or authority; in geography, refers to its territorial expression. To say an entity has <em>absolute sovereignty</em> over a territory, then, is to say they have ultimate authority over that territory.</p>
</dd>
<dt>State</dt>
<dd><p>A political territorial entity with <em>absolute sovereignty</em> over clearly-defined borders.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1 id="cultural-geography">Cultural Geography</h1>
<dl>
<dt>Culture</dt>
<dd><p>A very broad and complex idea that involves aspects of identity meaning, and ways of life that constitute some unique symbolic expression.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Forced Migration</dt>
<dd><p>Migration driven by poliitcal conflict or natural disaster, where people are forced to move against their will.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Migration</dt>
<dd><p>Simply put, geographical change in residence.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Pull Factor</dt>
<dd><p>Positive haracteristics of a place that prompt migrants to consider it as their destination.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Push Factor</dt>
<dd><p>Negative characteristics of a place that prompt people to consider migration.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Refugee</dt>
<dd><p>Someone that is a victim of forced migration.</p>
