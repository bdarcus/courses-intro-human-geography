# Basic Concepts

Distance
: In general, the space between two points or locations.

Absolute Distance
: Absolute distance is an objective measure that does not vary. Common 
  absolute measures of distance could be miles or kilometers, for example.

Relative Distance
: Relative distance varies depending on context: technology,
  the content between the locations, etc. For example:
    * Oxford is roughly forty-minutes by car from Cincinnati
    * New York is five hours by plane from Los Angeles
  Note that distance here depends among other things on how fast one
  travels; the times in the examples above assume a particular average speed.

Location
: Put simply, where something is on a two-dimensional plain. There
  are two predominant ways to understand this notion.

Absolute Location
: Absolute location does not vary depending on perspective. Common
  measures of absolute location include latitude and longitude.

Relative Location
: Relative location identifies where something is in relation to
  another location. For example:
    * Liberty, Indiana is West of Oxford
    * Canada is North of the United States

Scale
: The horizontal size of a given geographic unit, area, or process.

Site
: Related to location; where something is in the most basic sense, but
  also the characteristics of that place. For example, a city might be
  located on the coast at some absolute location, contain a natural
  harbor, and so forth.

Situation 
: A site's place in larger geographic context. For example,
a harbor wouldn't be much use without boats. An interior continental
location far from any water body might suggest intense isolation
without planes, trains and automobiles. The idea simply suggests that
a place's position in the world evolves based on changing technology,
politics, culture and so forth.

# Spatial Interaction

Accessibility 
: How easy it is to access a place. For example, for
much of human history, coastal locations with good natural harbors
provided greatly enhanced accessibilty. Conversely, a location in a
mountainous area often greatly dmininshes accessiblity.

Complementarity 
: When considering potential interactions between
places, complementarity refers to the fact that each much offer
something to the other.

Diffusion 
: The spread of something (a disease, an innovation,
information) from one location to another.

Diffusion originally comes from biology, where the concept is
understood as the movement (often across cell walls) of a solution of
high concentration to areas of low-concentration. The understanding in
geography is broadly similar, but differs in two important
respects. First, while biology may deal with scales even smaller than
individual cells, geography typically deals with processes happening
at much larger scales: the city, the region, the nation, the
globe. Second, geography (certainly human geography) is typically
concerned not so much with the movement of biophysical or chemical
material, but rather of more human things such as information, ideas,
culture, and so forth.

In human geography, we distinguish between two broadly different
mechanisms of diffusion.

Spatial Diffusion
: This is the most basic form of diffusion and involves movement from a
place to surrouding places. So the primary criterion that defines this
pattern of movement is absolute distance; movement happens first to
areas that are closest. It's for this reason the concept is also
sometimes called "contagious diffusion"; consider how a cold virus
spreads within a dorm room, or a campus, for example.

Hierarchical Diffusion
: In hierarchical diffusion, things diffuse not to areas that are
absolutely closest, but rather to areas of relative
distance. Consider, for example, that Syracuse, New York is absolutely
much closer to New York City than is Chicago. Nevertheless, we expect
much more traffic between New York and Chicago, than between New York
and Syracuse. For this reason, we often see diffusion happen first
between places which are large and have more intense spatial
interaction.

Intervening Opportunity
: When considering the possibility of interaction between any two
places, intervening opportunity refers to the reality that there are
always additional places that may offer the same benefits of
interaction. An intervening opportunity, then, can change the patterns
of connection between places.

Transferability 
: When considering whatever it is that is transferred
between two locations, transferability refers to the characteristics
of thing been transferred. For exampe, a tractor is not very
transferable, because it is large and very heavy. By contrast, a
tshirt or a computer chip has very high transerabilty.
