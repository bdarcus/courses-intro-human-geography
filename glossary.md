# Basic Concepts

Absolute Distance
:   Absolute distance is an objective measure that does not vary. Common
    absolute measures of distance could be miles or kilometers, for example.

Absolute Location
:   Absolute location does not vary depending on perspective or context. Common
    measures of absolute location include latitude and longitude.

Core
:   A grouping of countries that have high standards of living and diverse economies,
    extensive international trade, and substantial political power. Initially concentrated
    in Western Europe, the Core has expanded to include North America, Japan, and Australia.

Core-Periphery Model
:   A model that generalizes areas of the world, and their historically-evolving
    interdependencies. This model argues this relationship developed out of the
    historical-geography of colonialism, where Core colonial states in Western Europe
    developed political and economic power by extracing raw materials and labor from
    colonial Peripheral territories, and in turn dominated global trade.

Distance
:   In general, the space between two points or locations. There are two predominant
    ways to understand this notion: _Absolute Distance_  and _Relative Distance_.

Location
:   Put simply, where something is on a two-dimensional plain. There
    are two predominant ways to understand this notion: _Absolute Location_ and
    _Relative Location_. See also _Site_ and _Situation_.

Place
:   In both the English language generally, and in human geography in particular, _place_
    is a concept rich with nuance. At the most mundane, a place is just some location
    with a unique mix of characteristics. See also _Site_ and _Situation_, and _Location_.

Relative Distance
:   Relative distance varies depending on context: technology,
    the content between the locations, etc. For example:

      * Oxford is roughly forty-minutes by car from Cincinnati
      * New York is five hours by plane from Los Angeles

    Note that distance here depends among other things on how fast one
    travels; the times in the examples above assume a particular average speed.

Periphery
:   A grouping of former colonial countries that have lower standards of living
    and simpler economies, and relatively weak political power vis-a-vis the Core.
    Today, the Periphery includes broad areas of Africa, Latin America, and Asia.

Relative Location
:   Relative location identifies where something is in relation to
    other locations or places. For example:

      * Liberty, Indiana is West of Oxford
      * Canada is North of the United States
      * my favorite restaurant is next to the gas station

Scale
:   The horizontal size of a given geographic unit, area, or process. In geography,
    we typically talk in scales that range from the human body, to the street or
    or neightborhood, to the city or region, and on to the globe.

Site
:   Related to _location_; where something is in the most basic sense, but
    also the characteristics of that place. For example, a city might be
    located on the coast at some _absolute location_, contain a natural
    harbor, and so forth.

Situation
:   A site's place in larger geographic context. For example,
    a harbor wouldn't be much use without boats. An interior continental
    location far from any water body might suggest intense isolation
    without planes, trains and automobiles. The idea simply suggests that
    a place's position in the world evolves based on changing technology,
    politics, culture and so forth.

# Spatial Interaction

Accessibility
:   A characteristic of a _place_. How easy it is to access a place. For
    example, for much of human history, coastal locations with good
    natural harbors provided greatly enhanced accessibility. Conversely,
    a location in a mountainous area often greatly diminishes accessibility.

Complementarity
:   When considering potential interactions between
    places, complementarity refers to the fact that each much offer
    something to the other.

Diffusion
:   The spread of something (a disease, an innovation,
    information) from one _location_ to another.

    Diffusion originally comes from biology, where the concept is
    understood as the movement (often across cell walls) of a solution of
    high concentration to areas of low-concentration. The understanding in
    geography is broadly similar, but differs in two important
    respects. First, while biology may deal with scales even smaller than
    individual cells, geography typically deals with processes happening
    at much larger scales: the city, the region, the nation, the
    globe. Second, geography (certainly human geography) is typically
    concerned not so much with the movement of biophysical or chemical
    material, but rather of more human things such as information, ideas,
    culture, and so forth.

    In human geography, we distinguish between two broadly different
    mechanisms of diffusion: _Spatial Diffusion_ and _Hierarchical Diffusion_.

Hierarchical Diffusion
:   In hierarchical diffusion, things diffuse not to areas that are
    absolutely closest, but rather to areas of close  _relative
    distance_. Consider, for example, that Syracuse, New York is absolutely
    much closer to New York City than is Chicago. Nevertheless, we expect
    much more traffic between New York and Chicago, than between New York
    and Syracuse. For this reason, we often see diffusion happen first
    between places which are large and have more intense spatial
    interaction.

Intervening Opportunity
:   When considering the possibility of interaction between any two
    places, intervening opportunity refers to the reality that there are
    always additional places that may offer the same benefits of
    interaction. An intervening opportunity, then, can change the patterns
    of connection between places.

Spatial Diffusion
:   This is the most basic form of _diffusion_ and involves movement from a
    place to surrouding places. So the primary criterion that defines this
    pattern of movement is _absolute distance_; movement happens first to
    areas that are closest. It's for this reason the concept is also
    sometimes called _contagious diffusion_ (consider how a cold virus
    spreads within a dorm room, or a campus, for example).


Transferability
:   A characteristic of a _thing_. When considering whatever it is that
    is transferred between two _locations_, transferability refers to
    the characteristics of the thing being transferred. For example, a
    tractor is not very transferable, because it is large and very
    heavy. By contrast, a tshirt or a computer chip has very high
    transferabilty.

# Economic Geography

Agglomeration Economies
:   Circumstances that benefit from the spatial co-presence of different
    components of an economic process, where greater absolute distance would
    raise costs.

Comparative Advantage
:   The economic principle that says countries should specialize in
    what they do best, and trade. It might be understood as an
    underlying basis for arguments in favor of free trade.

Disagglomeration Economies
:   Circumstances that benefit from the spatial dispersal of different
    components of an economic process, where greater costs associated with
    greater absolute distance are outweighed by lowered costs elsewhere.

Divison of Labor
:   Most simply, different people doing different work as part of an economy.

Fordism
:   A social and economic system that involves vertically-integrated mass-production,
    relative peace between capital and labor mediated by strong
    government involvement.

Free Market
:   Conditions that involve minimal government in an economy, and so
    less regulation, less taxes, less government subsidies.

Free Trade
:   Conditions where barriers to international trade are
    minimized, and which encourages minimal or no tariffs or trade
    quotas. See also _Comparative Advantage_.

Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
:   The total market value of all goods and services produced within a
    domestic economy.

Human Development Index (HDI)
:   A composite development measure that includes health, education, and
    standard of living (for more, see [here][hdi]).

Import Substitution
:   An economic policy with high trade barriers and strong government
    involvement, designed to create a diverse, self-sufficient, national
    economy. Contrast this with _comparative advantage_ and _free trade_.

Informal Economy
:   Work that is not formally counted by governments. In much of the world,
    this involves informal selling of goods in informal markets, or on the
    street.

International Division of Labor
:   A spatial division of labor that spans international borders.

Modernization Theory
:   A theory of development that, as promoted by Walt Rostow in the
    1960s, argued that national economies exist along a hierarchy of
    five "stages." Based on the historical experience of Europe, it
    suggested specific steps governments could take (like investing in
    infrastructure) to create the conditions for their countries' to
    move up the hierarchy to greater levels of development.

Neoliberalism
:   An approach to development and economic policy that promotes _free
    market_ and _free trade_, and therefore minimal government
    involvement in economies. Generally might be understood as a
    development approach that promotes economic globalization.

New International Division of Labor
:   One way to describe the globalization of manufacturing economies
    beginning in the 1960s. This division of labor involved the movement of
    lower-skill manufacturing work from core to periphery and semi-periphery.

Old International Division of Labor
:   A division of labor largely associated with the era of European colonialism,
    where former colonies provided raw materials to core states, which in turn
    produced higher-value finished goods. Often colonial powers enforced these
    unequal trade relationships through force, or other coercion.

Post-Fordism
:   A social and economic system characterized by vertically-disintegrated
    production, and less government engagement in the economy, and in labor
    rights.

Spatial Divison of Labor
:   The fact that divisions of labor take place in space; that _where_ work
    gets done may be as significant as _who_ does that work.

Structural Adjustment Program (SAP)
:   A set of conditions the World Bank and the IMF imposes on loans they give to
    countries. These conditions typical include a range of broadly _neoliberal_
    policy reforms.

Vertical Integration
:   The integration of the complete range of a production process under the
    direct control of a firm. The classic example is the original _Ford Motor
    Company_, which owned the complete range from rubber plantations, to
    production lines, to auto dealerships and insurance.

Vertical Disintegration
:   Where firms spin off certain segments of their production process to other
    firms (subcontractors), giving more geographic and business flexibility.

# Political Geography

Geopolitics
:    The geographical relations of power among different entities;
     typically states. May involve various practical and imaginative dimensions.

Nation
:    An "imagined community" of people that assert a common identity
     rooted in a common historical experience, ethnicity, language,
     and so forth.

Nation-State
:    An idealized state geographically coterminous with a nation,
     typically without significant internal differences.

Sovereignty
:    Control or authority; in geography, refers to its territorial
     expression. To say an entity has _absolute sovereignty_ over a
     territory, then, is to say they have ultimate authority over that territory.

State
:    A political territorial entity with _absolute sovereignty_ over
     clearly-defined borders.

# Cultural Geography

Culture
:   A very broad and complex idea that involves aspects of identity
    meaning, and ways of life that constitute some unique symbolic expression.

Forced Migration
:    Migration driven by poliitcal conflict or natural disaster, where
     people are forced to move against their will.

Migration
:    Simply put, geographical change in residence.

Pull Factor
:    Positive haracteristics of a place that prompt migrants to consider it as
     their destination.

Push Factor
:    Negative characteristics of a place that prompt people to
     consider migration.

Refugee
:    Someone that is a victim of forced migration.

Transit state
:    A state that is midpoint destination for a migrant; a stop along the way from origin
     to ultimate destination. Example: Morocco is a transit state for people migrating from
     Subsaharan Africa to Europe.
