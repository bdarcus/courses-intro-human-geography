/*
The glossary is maintained as a simple json file, with:
  - term (plain text)
  - definition (markdown)
  - broader and narrow cross-references (optional)
The key value will be used for the html anchor id, sorting, 
cross-referencing, and also potentially to match against tags 
on recent news. It will also be used for conversion to SKOS
RDF.
